=================
Tiger Profiler is a code derived from [Light Weight Java Profiler](https://code.google.com/p/lightweight-java-profiler/). Tiger Profiler is resurrection of already very good profiler. The profiler is now capable of profiling on Mac OS X and Linux. The minor amount of Intel specific code has been replaced with portable equivalent of C++.
